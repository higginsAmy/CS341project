				<h3><strong>The Calendar</strong></h3>
				<div id="paragraphBodyLong">
					
						The calendar is available on the home screen to allow for optimum viewing without taking any extra steps
						after you log in. The calendar is already preconfigured to show any event you've signed up for. 
						Typically they are in green, however events cancelled by a volunteer or coach appear red 
						to let you know that the event is cancelled (rather than simply disappearing).
					
					<p>
						Clicking an event on the calendar allows you to take a closer look at it, allowing you to see details such as 
						when it starts and ends, how much room is left for new people to participate, and where it is.
					</p>
				</div>
			</a>
			
		<!--Section 1: General--> 	

			<a name ="Passwords">
				<h3><strong>Altering User Passwords</strong></h3>
				<div id="paragraphBodyShort">
					Only the administrator has access to user passwords, thus if a user wishes to reset their password they must contact the
					administrator. The administrator's responsibility for modifying a user's password and other user information can be found 
					in the section titled: <a href="help.html#ModUser">Modifying User Information</a>.
				</div>	
			</a>
			
			<a name="Donations">
				<h3><strong>Donations</strong></h3>
				<div id="paragraphBodyLong">
						With PayPal, making a donation to the Holmen Robotics Team is now easier than ever! From the guest page, 
						simply click the "Donate" button in the top utility bar, which will lead you the <a href="donate.html">donations page</a> 
						to a clickable PayPal link. The link will allow you to use your PayPal account or any 
						supported credit card to donate any amount you choose. 
						Every dollar counts!
					<p>
						Think you have something we could use? Tools, parts, or any other physical item can be donated to the team by 
						shipping it to the school or by visiting the high school's front office. Your generosity is appreciated!
					</p>
				</div>

		<!--Section 2: Students/Volunteers--> 	

			<a name="EventSignUp">
				<h3><strong>Signing up for an Event</strong></h3>
				<div id="paragraphBodyShort">
						Ready to get some work done? Click on the "Event Sign Up" button on the top utility bar and select an event
						from the list of openings. The system will let you know if there are any scheduling complications between it and
						an event you've already signed up for.
			
				</div>
			</a>

			<a name="EventUnenroll">
				<h3><strong>Unenrolling for an Event</strong></h3>
				<div id="paragraphBodyShort">
			
						Change your mind about an event you signed up for? You can remove your sign-up obligations easily by clicking the
						"Event Unenroll" button in the top utility bar, then select the event you'd like to remove from your calendar. It's that easy!
				</div>
			</a>

		<!--Section 3: Administrator/Volunteer -->
	
			<a name="CreateEvent">
				<h3><strong>Creating an Event</strong></h3>
				<div id="paragraphBodyShort">
			
						To create an event, simply click the "Add Event" button in the top utility bar. You will be greeted with a form,
						which will only be accepted if all applicable fields are filled out correctly. Upon submission,
						the event will be added to the calendar, and students and volunteers will be able to sign up for the event.
				</div>
			</a>
			
			<a name="ModEvent">
				<h3><strong>Modifying an Event</strong></h3>
				<div id="paragraphBodyLong">
					
						After an event is created, the user who created it is able to go back and change any of the event's details,
						or delete the event altogether. An administrator is allowed to modify or delete any event, even the ones or she
						is not the author of.
					<p>
						When an event is deleted, it will appear in red on the calendar, allowing users to see that the event was
						cancelled, allowing them to schedule accordingly.
					</p>
				</div>
			</a>
			
		<!--Section 4: administrator-->	
			
			<a name="SearchEvent">
				<h3><strong>Searching for an Event</strong></h3>
				<div id="paragraphBodyLong">
					
						While the calendar is meant to make looking at events simple, the administrator has the ability to search for events
						based on who created them, the date they are created on, or both. This is done by clicking the "search for events" button
						on the top utility bar, choosing your search type, and entering your search parameters accordingly.
					<p>
						Upon submitting the form, the administrator will be able to modify the events that match their search parameters.
						While it is impossible obtain no results when searching only by user, obtaining no results when searching by date
						or the comprehensive search can mean that there are either no events on the specified date, or no events by the specified
						user on the specified date.
					</p>
				</div>
			</a>
			
			<a name="AddUser">
				<h3><strong>Adding Users</strong></h3>
				<div id="paragraphBodyLong">
						
						Throughout the course of the FIRST Robotics season, it will be necessary for administrators to add new players or volunteers.
						Administrators may add volunteers by logging on, clicking the "Modify Users" button in the top utility bar,
						and selecting the option to add a new user. Administrators are the only users capable of adding users, and it is assumed that all students
						participating will be added at the beginning of the season. 
					<p>
						New students or volunteers may be added later by contacting the Administrator.
						Because students and volunteers will have different user privileges, it is important that the administrator chooses
						the proper classification for each user.
					</p>
				</div>
			</a>
			
			<a name="ModUser">
				<h3><strong>Modifying User Information</strong></h3>
				<div id="paragraphBodyLong">
						For various reasons, it may be necessary for an administrator to modify a user's account information. 
						Most notably, if a user forgets their password, they must contact the administrator to request it's reset. 
						Furthermore, if a student or volunteer drops out of the team, it is the administrator's responsibility to delete them.
						
					<p>
						Altering a user is done in a manner similar to adding a user: the administrator must log on, click the "Modify Users" 
						button on the top utility bar, and select the appropriate user to edit or delete.
